Installation Guide

Please read this entire document before install.

Steps:
1) Download files
The folder can be placed anywhere.

2) Unblock files
Before continuing with the install you must unblock the files. Windows blocks files when you download
them from the internet, so the first time you run this youï¿½ll need to unblock them. Open a PowerShell
window and navigate to the installation folder. Type in 'dir -recurse | unblock-file'.

3) Installation
This installer is designed to install on a single location. Open a PowerShell window and
navigate to the installation folder if you have not already done so. Type in
'. .\Setup-SQLInventory.ps1 -ServerName "Server" -DBName "Database" -Destination "X:\"'.

4) Post installation
Open the SQL job called 'Collection-SQLServerInventory'. Edit Step 1 of the job and set the command
to the location of the 'Get-SQLServerInventory.ps1' file. For example: PowerShell -File "C:\PS\Get-SQLServerInventory.ps1"
This job is set to disabled by default, enable it once you are ready.

*Also requires dbatools. See website for documentation and installation instructions.


Folders:
1) InstallLog
Holds the txt files from each install. Format 'YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt'.

2) Scripts
Holds the sql files for creating database objects including schema and tables. Also contains 
'InstallOrder.txt' which is a list of the files to be run.

3) PS
Do NOT alter this directory in any way. This directory will copy over to the Destination variable
that is set during the install.


Customizing the install further:
1) Create and save your script into the Scripts folder.

2) Add the name of that script into the 'InstallOrder.txt' file.

3) Run the installation as described above.
